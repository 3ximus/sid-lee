      Passion isn't just a fruit… It's a way of life. It's the way I live-
      passionately and unforgiving. I’m passionate about many things, some of
      which being nostalgia, community, exploration, and overall, creativity.
      Creativity is what I have known my whole life. Now how can I really prove
      this to you? Well, here is this website showing a self-portrait of myself
      that I’ve painted on a road sign. And, while BARRÉ here implies being
      closed off, I am turned away from the word in search of more. To push the
      boundaries of contemporary art has been my main focus since moving to
      Montreal (Tiohtià:ke ) in 2020. I’ve made it my goal, and style, to mesh
      the old medium of oil painting with a modern twist, reclaimed road signs
      with bold iconography.

      I find interest in the mundane and the small, the forgotten and
      unconsidered. Everything can spark my interest, and much has, but to work
      alongside those like-minded and different would excel this process and
      allow for new collaborations and insights. So about my passions as a
      whole, they are ever-growing and awe-inspiring. To simply explain them
      wouldn’t do them justice.
