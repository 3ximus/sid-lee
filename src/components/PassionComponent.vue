    Passion isn't just a fruit… It's a way of life. It's the way I live-
    passionately and unforgiving. I’m passionate about many things, some of
    which being nostalgia, community, exploration, and overall, creativity.
    Creativity is what I have known my whole life. Now how can I really prove
    this to you? Well, here is this website showing a self-portrait of myself
    that I’ve painted on a road sign. And, while BARRÉ here implies being closed
    off, I am turned away from the word in search of more. To push the
    boundaries of contemporary art has been my main focus since moving to
    Montreal (Tiohtià:ke ) in 2020. I’ve made it my goal, and style, to mesh the
    old medium of oil painting with a modern twist, reclaimed road signs with
    bold iconography.

    I find interest in the mundane and the small, the forgotten and
    unconsidered. Everything can spark my interest, and much has, but to work
    alongside those like-minded and different would excel this process and allow
    for new collaborations and insights. So about my passions as a whole, they
    are ever-growing and awe-inspiring. To simply explain them wouldn’t do them
    justice.
